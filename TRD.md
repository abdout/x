### Technology Used  
**Auth.js:** for providing the structural foundation of components.  
**Tailwind CSS:**  for styling and customizing components.  
**React:** for developing dynamic and interactive UI components.  
**TypeScript:** for strong typing and enhancing code quality.

### Project Structure  
src  
├── app  
│   ├── page.tsx  
│   └── global.css  
└── component  
    ├── atom  
    │   ├── button  
    │   ├── input  
    │   ├── icon  
    │   ├── image  
    │   └── radio  
    └── molecule  
        ├── sidebar  
        └── navbar  

page.tsx: Renders reusable components defined in the component directory.
global.css: Defines global styles, including styles for headings (h1-h6).
atom: Contains individual UI components that represent basic building blocks.
molecule: Comprises composite UI components built by combining atoms.

### Component Structure

Arrow Functional Component: Utilize arrow function syntax for defining components. You can streamline this process by using the "s7+" extension in VS Code, which allows you to quickly generate arrow function components by typing "rafce". Additionally, ensure your code is formatted consistently by using the Prettier extension.

### Design Style
**Sharp Corners**  
**No Shadow**  
**No Effects**  
**Hover:** default opacity 80% when hover increasers to 100%
this is applied to icons, texts, cards, inputs, buttons   
**Color Scheme:** follow the color scheme in figma.  
**Sharp and Fill Icons**  
**Outlined Icons for bars**  
**Follow Design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XhL9031u667fhzTDE4Lq0T/Atom?type=design&node-id=1-3&mode=design&t=o4R5Dal6hV5pzlic-0)**

### Naming Convention
**Folders and Files:** Named in lowercase, singular, and using direct words.
**Components:** Named in PascalCase (first letter of each word capitalized), with the second word also capitalized if applicable.
Example: Button, Input, Icon, Image, Radio, Sidebar, Navbar.
